## Description

This application allows a user to keep of their employees. The user can sort them by last name or search to narrow their results. It currently fetches some data from [a random user API]("https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&nat=u"), but a user can easily implement their own list of employees with .json file. 

## Installation

````
npm i

````
npm start
````


## Usage
